# Mariana Trench Educational App - Project Brief

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing an interactive browser application to display information in a fun and interesting way.

## MVP

* User should be able to navigate through different sections of content
* App should display multimedia information on things the user might find on their journey
* Interactive background
* Tablet responsive
* Depth gauge in meters
* Use of MongoDB database and Express backend framework

## EXTENSIONS

* Make it mobile responsive
* Ocean sounds effects
* A quiz when the user reaches the bottom
* Pressure and temperature readouts for particular depths
* Form for the user to add their name, height at the beginning of their journey, so that we can create depth gauge based on their height
* Quiz High Score Leaderboard
* Animations
* Quiz between levels to allow user to progress deeper
* Different size buildings to compare the depth
* Give user a prize of a fish/sea creature depending on their score (with mini facts about it)

Challenges and Solutions

Time Challenges
At the start we had a team of four for one week project, however, unfortunately a team member had to leave team 2 days into the project due to unforeseeable circumstances. We also experienced hardware issues which also reduced available developing time. We worked together as a team really well to overcome those challenges: 

Used an agile working model and ran mini sprints every day to see what we achieved and whats the next most inmportant thing to focus on. 
Remained positive and worked hard focussing on achieving the MVP and extensions we'd defined together.
Used different methods to stay in touch as a team: when not in person communicating via Slack, Zoom and Discord.
Used pair and mob programming to resolve complex issues

Design Challenges

We wanted app to be fun and colourful, but specific project subject made it nearly impossible to find specific visual assets that we needed. We divided big chunks of different subjects into smaller ones, and then reserched and created content for it individually (icons, background illustrations) sharing knowledge of specific techniques (we used Canva a lot) that we have as individuals.
We alsodecided on a colour palette early to keep design consistency.



Learning Points
Consolidated learning from JavaScript Module (Weeks 5-9 of Codeclan)
Experience working in a team with other developers
Overcoming development challenges collaboratively
Using Agile working methods
Using Git/GitHub for a multi person project



Run Locally

Clone the project and go to the project directory:

  cd mariana_trench_project
Install dependencies in both the client and the server folders:

cd client
npm install

cd server
npm install
Seed the database. Within the server folder:

npm run seeds
Run express (leave running in a terminal window). Within the server folder:

npm run server:dev
Run React development environment (leave running in a terminal window). Within client folder:

npm start
The application is running on port 3000 so visit http://localhost:3000/ to try out!
